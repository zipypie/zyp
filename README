#TO INSTALL FLASK

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:


python --version
If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once Python is installed, open a terminal or command prompt.

Create a new directory (optional) for your Flask project. You can skip this step if you want to install Flask globally.


mkdir myflaskproject
cd myflaskproject

It is recommended to create and activate a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment (optional step):

For Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Now, with the virtual environment activated (if you chose to use one), run the following command to install Flask:


pip install flask
This command will install Flask and its dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, you can start building Flask applications.



#TO INSTALL NeoVim
Open PowerShell or Command Prompt as an administrator.

If you don't have Chocolatey installed, run the following command to install Chocolatey:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))


After Chocolatey is installed, run the following command to install Neovim:


choco install neovim
Chocolatey will download and install Neovim along with its dependencies. Follow the prompts during the installation process.

Once the installation is complete, you can launch Neovim by opening a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window and typing nvim.
