#TO INSTALL FLASK

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the following command:


python --version
If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official Python website (https://www.python.org) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Once Python is installed, open a terminal or command prompt.

Create a new directory (optional) for your Flask project. You can skip this step if you want to install Flask globally.


mkdir myflaskproject
cd myflaskproject

It is recommended to create and activate a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies isolated. Run the following commands to create and activate a virtual environment (optional step):

For Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Now, with the virtual environment activated (if you chose to use one), run the following command to install Flask:


pip install flask
This command will install Flask and its dependencies.

Once the installation is complete, you can start building Flask applications.
